PROJECT_2
=========

The second print attempt using RepRap. Thi smodel had a size constraint of 6cm at most in either direction.
I was still thinking about architectural elements in small scale, I used columns again, but this time to support a long thin structure.
This was an exploration of what shapes could be supported.
